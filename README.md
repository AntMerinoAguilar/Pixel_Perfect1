# Pixel Perfect Challenge at BeCode 🎨

This repository contains the result of a **Pixel Perfect** exercise, completed during my training at **BeCode**. The goal was to replicate a design provided in **Figma** with **HTML** and **CSS**, respecting every detail of the layout and styles.

## Overview 📋

In this project, I worked on:  

- Recreating a pixel-perfect design from **Figma** in **HTML** and **CSS**.  
- Paying close attention to **margins**, **padding**, **widths**, and **colors** as specified in the design.  
- Avoiding the use of **Flexbox** or **CSS Grid** to strengthen foundational CSS skills.  

## Why This Project? 🤔

The **Pixel Perfect** challenge is crucial for developing precision and attention to detail as a web developer. Through this exercise, I have:  

- Learned to translate designs into code with high fidelity.  
- Improved my ability to interpret and apply design specifications (e.g., spacing, typography, colors).  
- Practiced writing clean and organized HTML and CSS code.  

## Repository Structure 📂

The repository is structured as follows:  

- **`index.html`**: The main HTML file containing the structure of the page.  
- **`styles.css`**: The CSS file for styling the page according to the design specifications.  
- **`images/`**: Contains the images used in the project.
